      location: Onsite in Denver, Colorado, then Work Remote from New York, New York
      accomplishments:
        - Started the implementation of our service orientated architecture in Ruby on Rails moving our stack away from ColdFusion. This involved engineering six new microservices and migrating our servers to Heroku. By partnering off hours by with an external consultant this implementation provided leverage to drive culture change.
        - Refactored our code deployment process to Git Flow via GitHub moving the entire organization away from SVN.  This included mandating testing coverage, no longer working on live production code, and pair code reviews. Outside of the technology department training for non-technical committers helped drive these modifications.
        - Revamped and revitalized the RetailHub Enterprise Content Management Software using the ColdBox MVC framework.  This full rebuild replaced ten years of legacy code with new workflows built on modern UI/UX principles. Organizing every customer tool in a single workspace increased application performance, and resulted in better client relationships.

      accomplishments:
        - Managed the construction of a Service Orientated Architecture to drive content to over 600 statically generated websites.

This resulted in covering Black Friday Sales traffic at scale while delivering new content and reduced DevOps overhead costs.
        - Instituted a focus on training and mentoring to reduce knowledge silos, grow junior developers, and reduce project time to completion.  Online courses, real-time pairing, and monetary awards helped achieve measurable success.
        - Transformed legacy communications by implementing Slack enterprise-wide.  CodeClimate GPAs, Git Flow notifications, NewRelic Alerts, and our Emoji based Pull Request game defined this culture shift.
        - Coordinated and cultivated external client relationships built on top of our Service Orientated Architecture.  API customers could push and pull data into content management systems allowing us to grow revenue opportunities with the same resources.

      accomplishments:
        - Engineered a 2-Way ETL Microservice with API to break apart an existing monolithic application and legacy architecture.  Acting as a glorified facade, the application relayed communications between many 3rd party providers and our monorail in real time.  Automated webhooks, polling events, and API translations provided flexibility for varying provider complexity. Standardized style guide and test coverage metrics were also respected.
        - Instituted Slack and Git Flow modeled after successful engineering teams and remote focused cultures. Room configurations supported both engineering and sales. ETL customers joined us in guest rooms for asynchronous communication across many time zones, while code processes increased code quality and test coverage.

        - Architected Licensing 2.0 which required a multi-stage multi-epic rollout process and hooked into every component related to our design content in the backend API. While I was only able to complete 2/3 epics, each component completed in near isolation totaled over 100 files and impacted nearly every feature of our architecture.  The final epic was comprised of 10 feature tickets, > 127 files, full test coverage via rspec and multiple data migrations.
        - Converted existing legacy Minitest specs to Rspec, and implemented test execution on CI via the Parallels gem.  This stopgap solution cut down our testing processing time from 25 minutes down to 8 minutes on average.
