summary: This quote from Rich Roll in the book "Finding Ultra" sums up my life's journey to this very moment. "Pursue what’s in your heart, and the universe will conspire to support you." When I left my hometown I had one destination in mind.  Today, I am up to three and counting. I'm not sure where my covered wagon on the journey of life will go next, but this journey matters more to me than the destination.
