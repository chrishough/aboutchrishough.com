summary: The quote, "Pursue whatâ€™s in your heart, and the universe will conspire to support you." from Rich Roll, in the book "Finding Ultra" sums up my life's journey.  When I left my hometown of Chicago I had one destination in mind. That was Boulder Colorado.  Today, I am in Portland Oregon and I'm not sure where my covered wagon will land next.  The journey matters more to me than the destination.

locations:
  chicago: I was the oldest of four born into an extremely hard working blue collar family. My mother is nearly all Polish, while my father is Irish and German.  Both of them never went to college.  My dad's unparalleled attention to detail made him the best craftsman I have ever met. He can fix anything.  My mother is by far the most people person I know.  She can sell anything.  In fact, she has been in the top five saleswomen at AT&T nearly her entire career. Growing up they worked their asses off working every minute of overtime they could get, and there were times I would only see them for a few hours each week.  While I didn't understand this growing up, as I got older their sacrifices have made more sense.  Without them, I would never have been in school with the kids of CEOs.  I would never have learned about hard work, persistence, and passion.  Now my family is far from flaws.  We have many, and we are nowhere near perfect nor we do ever claim to be.  What I do know is I would not be the person I am today without them in my life. Chicago will always have my roots. It's the reason I am a strong capitalist today, but as I got older I was called to leave.   

  boulder: I went to Carmel H.S. in Mundelein, Ilinois.  As I approached my senior year I had a number of conversations with one of my best friends outlining a grand vision of attending college at the University of Colorado in Boulder.  Unfortunately, life took me in a different direction and we lost touch with one another.  Over time I started to grow more and more impatient with the direction my life was heading.  Call it a blessing in disguise, but after eight years apart an old friend from high school found me from finding my father on yahoo. We immediately reconnected and the fire in my belly for Colorado burned at its highest levels ever.  Truth me be told his phone call put me at a crossroads in my life.  I could either stay in Chicago or explore the idea of Boulder.  I wasn't happy at home and those visions I had when I was younger were telling me something.  So I booked a trip to visit him in Colorado Springs.  I will never forget that.  We took a scenic drive up to the top of Pike's Peak.  It was unbelievable.  At one point, I glanced over at my friend and watched him feed his dog water out of his hands.  I will never know why I did this, but I knelt down and started touching the dirt with my hands.  At this very moment, I knew I had to move Boulder.  Call it a sign from God, I have no idea, but I knew it in my heart and soul.  That very moment completely changed my life, and I had a lease on Pearl Street a year later. 

  manhattan: I loved my time in Boulder, and I thought it would be my last stop.  It wasn't!  I never considered NYC in my journey through the Oregon Trail, but it happened.  I loved it.  Truth be told, I have considered moving back there a number of times, and my brother lives there now!  My apartment on the Upper West Side was all about location at 83rd and Columbus.  I say location because I was used to killing giant cockroaches and rats in my living room and kitchen.  I learned that rats scream when caught in traps and learn quickly.  Cockroaches can fly, and it takes a baseball bat to kill them.  I was a regular at the largest meetup on meetup.com the NYTECH meetup, and I picked up ruby from a class at NYU.  It was also my first leap into full-time remote working.  My apartment had two windows with slotted steal bars and only a few overhead lights.  I quickly learned all of the tricks to working remotely and staying focused.  I learned that fitness was not optional when it comes to working in technology too.  Equinox is still the best gym I have been a member at.  As a foodie NYC was a dream.  Sadly it cost me 20lbs on the waistline. My favorite restaurant of all time is Per Se, and I learned all about A5 steaks there.   I still maintain a huge list of favorite dining spots and make the city a regular adventure nearly every year.  Finally, I truly got to explore my love of the arts there.  I have spent hours in The MOMA, The MET, and The Whitney.  I have drawn inspiration from those times for my tattoos.  

  pdx: When I decided to leave "Rome" of the U.S. I considered going back to Boulder, or to San Francisco.  At the time, I was pretty frustrated with burning money on high taxes and cost of living, and after watching Portlandia, Portland Oregon was selected. I figured if a modern hippie like me was driving a VW bus out West and Boulder was too small where would he go next.  From afar, Portland seemed legit.  I have been here now for over six years and counting.  I have eaten all over the city and can say without a shadow of a doubt, Portlandia is factual. The tattoo ink never runs dry here, and people are super chilled.   I do feel like I am one of the few capitalists though, and I founded a meetup to support those ideals.  It started out as a fork of the PDX.rb group named "Ruby on Rails PDX."  Today we are called "Full Stack PDX" and grew to over one thousand members in under a few years.  I have now made mentoring and giving back where I can a priority in my life.  I have regularly run the career advisory room at Mentorship Saturdays, and spend time with my church community at St. Mary's Cathedral.  My faith has come back to me in PDX, and it's something I will never let go of again.  

  next: PDX will not be the last stop on this journey.  While I will always consider it an amazing place, its time will pass.  I met an amazing beautiful super smart partner here and when she wraps up medical school we are going to bounce. Right now my fingers are crossed for sunny "never snowy" San Diego.  Yes, I know it is the exact opposite weather wise of here.  The rain here is killing me slowly, and I swear I have watched my natural tone skin become pasty white over the years.  Also, I want to be able to run, mountain bike, and explore all year round. I rarely venture out during our nine months tropical monsoon season each year.  I also miss being around high fashion, style, and a beach that does not require a wet suit to get in.  I want to be around more capitalists. Who knows though... I used to plan for everything down to the finest detail.  Now I like to use the term "trend" and go with the flow as much as I can.  Call it the secret, but I figure if I write this down on paper, it may just happen.
