summary: I started working around the age of twelve mowing lawns across my neighborhood with two other business partners.  We never understood the ratio of time to square footage so we significantly undercharged.  Looking back, it was not efficient but it was the first business I had built for myself.  It worked.  I have delivered newspapers, sold lemonade, washed dishes, worked at McDonald's and have fought for everything I have today. To say I am a passionate person is an understatement.  If you listen to Gary Vaynerchuk, I am sure you have heard him preach the following.  “If you ever say to somebody else, why are you up so early? That is the quickest tell you are not a winning player. If that has ever crossed your mind, you’ve lost.”  I could not agree more.  I will rest when I die. Friday is just another day for me. I believe in working hard and playing harder.

goals:
  fitness: Our health directly impacts our ability to operate at peak performance.  While I am not perfect in this area, just check out my fat kid food problems on Instagram, I am working to continually improve.  It's one of the reasons when I organize community events I ditch the fucking pizza for healthier food options.  As for corporate environments, I have never understood why companies give out free sugar-packed snacks and soda then complain about the three-o-clock crashes.  I would rather have my gym membership reimbursed. In fact, you could say, picking up heavy things and putting them down at the Iron Church is part of my religion.  When I lived in Boulder I started getting into races like the Bolder Boulder, and the Warrior Dash.  A recent injury has delayed my goals in this area, but I have decided to forgo winter sports in favor of future races.  Truth be told, I  never thought these types of events would be possible for a body type like mine.  Now I can't stop thinking about them. I guess being Type-A and beating up your body go hand in hand. No matter where you are at today, or how old you are, it is never too late to start.  I saw a shirt on the back of a pretty large man walking in a race in Colorado. I will never forget it. On the back, it stated something like, "I am one step of ahead of where you are sitting on the couch." It only takes a small amount of effort to try.  I will always try and believe it is better to have tried and failed than never tried at all.
