summary: When I plan my day, the month, the quarter, and even the year I believe the body and mind need to be working together.  Sure, we set granular tasks, but I try to focus on yearly themes that can shape my life over the long game, not just the short. A quote from the infamous Arnold Schwarzenegger comes to my mind here, "Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength." Life is not easy, no matter which level you are playing at.  We need a vision to prevent us from going in circles, or worst yet, backwards.  Ideally that vision pairs with our passion to make the reality we seek even a possibility for us in this life.
