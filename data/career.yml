executive_summary: Hard work, passion, attention to detail, and being self-motivated are all part of my DNA. I thrive in organizations with a culture of learning. Where coding, design, and product decisions are a collaborative team sport. To me, a strong engineering culture values quality, style, testing, and family. This means our craft, and what we do outside the workplace matters. In life and business, I drive decisions with data versus throwing darts at a board. I'm more pragmatic versus dogmatic and believe there is an infinite set of ways to solve a complex problem. I align best with corporate cultures that value empathy, family, and laughter. Offline you will find me organizing community events, mentoring, reading, and bodybuilding. We all have one life, and one chance to play this game the best we can play it. I am thankful for every day I get to play and work my best to be the best version of myself I can be.
