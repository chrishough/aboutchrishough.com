executive_summary: Hard work, passion, attention to detail, and being self-motivated are all part of my DNA. I thrive in organizations with a culture of learning. Where coding, design, and product decisions are a collaborative team sport. To me, a strong engineering culture values quality, style, testing, and family. This means our craft, and what we do outside the workplace matters. In life and business, I drive decisions with data versus throwing darts at a board. I'm more pragmatic versus dogmatic and believe there is an infinite set of ways to solve a complex problem. I align best with corporate cultures that value empathy, family, and laughter. Offline you will find me organizing community events, mentoring, reading, and bodybuilding. We all have one life, and one chance to play this game the best we can play it. I am thankful for every day I get to play and work my best to be the best version of myself I can be.

      learnings: Adobe ColdFusion, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Fusebox Framework, Enterprise SDLC, Performance and Process Management, High Availability and Monitoring, Scalability, Service Orientated Architectures 
      accomplishments: 
        - First exposure to compiling annual performance reviews and peer metrics for five engineers in our five-state Midwest region.  This included writing development processes, software style guidelines, scalability standards, and pairing.
        - Engineered a metrics-driven multi-tiered dashboard application serving actionable data to the enterprise. By organizing data into passive and reactive pods each level of the organization could have a direct impact on performance.  This resulted in reduced expenses, increased productivity, and cases of prevented fraud.
        - Standardized process delivery online replacing legacy paper binders across all call centers.  The mission critical handbook applications required 24/7 uptime, and real-time administrative updates.  This software increased customer satisfaction scores, reduced outages, and reduced visits for repairs.
        - Allowing training managers to schedule, track, and administer course materials online reduced knowledge silos.  This resulted in increased customer satisfaction, reduced outages, and increased employee happiness.
      accolades: 'Key Contributor Awards: 2002 - 2006, 2007 from the Installation and Repair Organization.

      position: Web Applications Engineer
      dates: August 2009 – April 2014
      location: Onsite in Denver, Colorado, then Work Remote from New York, New York
      accomplishments: 
        - Started the implementation of our service orientated architecture in Ruby on Rails moving our stack away from ColdFusion. This involved engineering six new microservices and migrating our servers to Heroku. By partnering off hours by with an external consultant this implementation provided leverage to drive culture change.
        - Refactored our code deployment process to Git Flow via GitHub moving the entire organization away from SVN.  This included mandating testing coverage, no longer working on live production code, and pair code reviews. Outside of the technology department training for non-technical committers helped drive these modifications.
        - Revamped and revitalized the RetailHub Enterprise Content Management Software using the ColdBox MVC framework.  This full rebuild replaced ten years of legacy code with new workflows built on modern UI/UX principles. Organizing every customer tool in a single workspace increased application performance, and resulted in better client relationships.

      accomplishments: 
        - Managed the construction of a Service Orientated Architecture to drive content to over 600 statically generated websites.  The strategic initiative of the team was to replace our legacy ColdFusion architecture with a Ruby on Rails backend, and JavaScript-driven front end.  This resulted in covering Black Friday Sales traffic at scale while delivering new content and reduced DevOps overhead costs.
        - Instituted a focus on training and mentoring to reduce knowledge silos, grow junior developers, and reduce project time to completion.  Online courses, real-time pairing, and monetary awards helped achieve measurable success.
        - Transformed legacy communications by implementing Slack enterprise-wide.  CodeClimate GPAs, Git Flow notifications, NewRelic Alerts, and our Emoji based Pull Request game defined this culture shift.
        - Coordinated and cultivated external client relationships built on top of our Service Orientated Architecture.  API customers could push and pull data into content management systems allowing us to grow revenue opportunities with the same resources.

      accomplishments: 
        - Engineered a 2-Way ETL Microservice with API to break apart an existing monolithic application and legacy architecture.  Acting as a glorified facade, the application relayed communications between many 3rd party providers and our monorail in real time.  Automated webhooks, polling events, and API translations provided flexibility for varying provider complexity. Standardized style guide and test coverage metrics were also respected.
        - Instituted Slack and Git Flow modeled after successful engineering teams and remote focused cultures. Room configurations supported both engineering and sales. ETL customers joined us in guest rooms for asynchronous communication across many time zones, while code processes increased code quality and test coverage.

      accomplishments: 
        - Managed the hiring process for additional mid-level and senior backed engineers, and assisted with the hiring of our first project manager.
        - Spearheaded the rollout of our Agile Scrum process structure and Sizing via Fibonacci numbers, and presented on Git Flow and Semver for future microservices.
        - Architected Licensing 2.0 which required a multi-stage multi-epic rollout process and hooked into every component related to our design content in the backend API. While I was only able to complete 2/3 epics, each component completed in near isolation totaled over 100 files and impacted nearly every feature of our architecture.  The final epic was comprised of 10 feature tickets, > 127 files, full test coverage via rspec and multiple data migrations.
        - Converted existing legacy Minitest specs to Rspec, and implemented test execution on CI via the Parallels gem.  This stopgap solution cut down our testing processing time from 25 minutes down to 8 minutes on average.
