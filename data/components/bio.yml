slogan: "Founder and engineering leader passionate about building high-impact products, empowering remote teams, and integrating AI to push the boundaries of what’s possible. I build with Ruby, architect APIs, and engineer intelligent systems that amplify creativity, clarity, and execution. <br/> I lead with heart and operate with intention—engineering not just software, but environments where people grow and thrive. Whether I’m mentoring a team, shipping a product, or shaping new AI-driven workflows, I approach it all with craftsmanship and care. <br/> My philosophy is simple: optimize everything—your codebase, your body, your mindset. From chasing a Half Ironman to rebuilding myself from the inside out, I live by the belief that our greatest work starts within. I’m obsessed with growth, driven by purpose, and fueled by the thrill of crafting things that resonate, endure, and matter. <br/> The goal isn’t just to ship software—it’s to build experiences that make people feel, teams that perform with soul, and a life I never want to escape from. <br/> Let’s craft something that outlives us—together, and enjoy the thrill while we’re at it."
