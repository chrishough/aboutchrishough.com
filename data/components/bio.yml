slogan: First Principles Thinker. Founder. Engineer. Strategic Technologist. Chris is a quality-driven builder with an abundance mindset and a deep belief that the only meaningful competition is with oneself—mentally, physically, and spiritually. He approaches engineering with craftsmanship, product with empathy, and leadership with clarity. Outside of work, he stays grounded through strength training, endurance sports, and the kind of adventures that demand grit and growth. His values are lived—and in some cases, inked.
